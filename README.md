# Economic Discord Bot

## **Hello**, I created an economic bot for discord north. With it, you can make a role store, issue money, and view the leaderboard by currency. You can also build support for your server using tickets.
To create a new database. Just delete mine. Launching the bot via "start.bat"

## Commands available in the bot:
### > ___Economic the commands:___

_!adward <user_nickname> <amount> - Give an award to the user_

_!deprive <user_nick> <amount> - Select any amount of currency_

_!balance - View the balance of any user_

_!leaderboard - View the top 10 servers by balance_

_!help - Use the commands that are in the bot_


### > ___Ticket the commands:___
_!ticket - Creating a window for users so that they can create a ticket using a button_

_!close <#ID Channel> - In general, the !close command is integrated into every ticket that will be created by the user (only the administrator and the ticket creator can close using this button and command), but using this command you can manually close any ticket_

_!status - look at how many open tickets there are_

> [!NOTE]
> New commands added:
> !shop and !buy
> Also, when using these commands with different conditions, errors are displayed in the console. Also, for each error, the time at which it occurred is shown. Over time, with each command in the code the error and its time will be shown
