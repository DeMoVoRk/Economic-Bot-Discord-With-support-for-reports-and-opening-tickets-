# Economic Discord Bot

## **Hello**, I created an economic bot for discord server. With it, you can make a role store, issue money, and view the leaderboard by currency. You can also build support for your server using tickets.

> [!WARNING]
> In order for the bot to send open tickets to the ticket chat, you need to create a chat and insert the channel ID

> [!TIP]
> To create a new database. Just delete mine. Launching the bot via "start.bat" :shipit:
