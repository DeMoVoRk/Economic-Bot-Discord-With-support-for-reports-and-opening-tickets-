# Economic Discord Bot
# Банкирный крот 

### **Hello**, I created an economic bot for discord server. With it, you can make a role store, issue money, and view the leaderboard by currency. You can also build support for your server using tickets

> [!WARNING]
> In order for the bot to send open tickets to the ticket chat, you need to create a chat and insert the channel ID

> [!TIP]
> To create a new database. Just delete mine. Launching the bot via "start.bat" :shipit:

## Commands available in the bot:
### > ___Economic the commands:___

!help - _Use the commands that are in the bot_

!award <user_nickname> <amount> - _Give an award to the user_

!deprive <user_nick> <amount> - _Select any amount of currency_

!balance - _View the balance of any user_

!leaderboard - _View the top 10 servers by balance_

!shop - _Open a store with current roles_

!buy <name_role> - _Buy the specified role from the store_

### > ___Ticket the commands:___

!ticket - _Creating a window for users so that they can create a ticket using a button_

!close <#ID Channel> - _In general, the !close command is integrated into every ticket that will be created by the user (only the administrator and the ticket creator can close using this button and command), but using this command you can manually close any ticket_

!status - _look at how many open tickets there are_

> [!NOTE]
> What's new in update 0.03v
> For the !balance command, an image with balance information is created. Under the balance, interactive buttons have been created to go to the store and transfer currency to another user. Accrual of lists for the fact that the user is in the voice channel
